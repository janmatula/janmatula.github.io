We present a comprehensive dataset of X-ray 3D computed tomography images of the developing mouse head with high-quality manual segmentation masks of cartilaginous nasal capsules. The provided μCT images can be used for studying any other major structure within the developing mouse heads. The high quality of the manually segmented models of nasal capsules may be instrumental to understanding the complex process of the development of the face in a mouse model.
