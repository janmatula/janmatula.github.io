Manual segmentation of cartilage tissue in micro CT images of mouse embryos is a very time-consuming process and significantly increases the time required for the research of mammal facial structure development. It is possible to solve this problem by using a fully-automatic segmentation algorithm. In this paper, a fully-automatic segmentation method is proposed using a convolutional neural network trained on manually segmented data. The architecture of the proposed convolutional network is based on the U-Net architecture with its encoding part substituted for the encoding part of the VGG16 classification convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet database of labelled images. The proposed network achieves average Dice coefficient 0.88 in comparison to manually segmented images.
