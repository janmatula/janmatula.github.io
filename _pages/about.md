I am a first year PhD student at the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC). I work in the Laboratory of X-ray computed micro- and nano- tomography. My job consits of finding possible applications of artificial intelligence algorithms in our image processing tasks and implementing them. My programming language of choice is Python.
