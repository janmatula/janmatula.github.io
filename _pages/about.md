I am a PhD student at the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC). I work in the Laboratory of X-ray computed micro- and nano- tomography. My work consists of finding possible applications of deep learning algorithms in our image processing tasks and implementing them. I also deal with image data processing tasks in general for both research projects and cooperations with industry.
